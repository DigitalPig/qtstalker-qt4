BUGS

The *bugs* might be lurking in the shadows and corners; since, this is
just a version 0.36 backward compatible and almost working QT4 based
branch; hence, major improvements and, or enhancements are not accepted
here except for the fixates and, or small patches.

FIX:

    See TODO, and search FIX directives in the source files.

NOTE:
    The upstream is busy revising design and making heavy changes; users
    are requested to use CVS head sources to build, test and report back
    bugs and, or feature requests.
